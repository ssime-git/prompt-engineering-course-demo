Effective Prompt Engineering Techniques
1. Specificity
Creating specific and detailed prompts can help reduce the noise in generated responses and increase their accuracy.

Avoid vague or open-ended questions that may yield irrelevant results.
Use precise language to define what you want the model to achieve.
Example: Instead of: "Write a story about a character who learns something new." Try: "Write a 200-word story about a character who discovers a hidden talent and overcomes their fear to perform in front of an audience."

2. Contextualization
Providing context can help the model understand the nuances of your request and generate more relevant responses.

Include relevant background information or previous conversations.
Use specific dates, times, locations, or events to ground the prompt in reality.
Example: Instead of: "Write a summary of the latest news." Try: "Summarize the recent breakthroughs in renewable energy announced at the annual Green Technology Conference in New York City on March 15th."

3. Evaluation Criteria
Clearly defining what makes a successful response can help guide the model's generation process.

Specify the desired tone, style, or format.
Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure success.
Example: Instead of: "Write a poem about love." Try: "Compose a 12-line sonnet with a romantic tone and a structured rhyme scheme, using iambic pentameter."
